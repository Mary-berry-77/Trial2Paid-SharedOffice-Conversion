# üìò Shared Office Trial Conversion Analysis

This project analyses behavioural log data from a shared office provider to uncover key drivers of trial-to-paid user conversion and proposes actionable strategies based on user segmentation.

---

### üß≠ TL;DR (Quick Summary)

#### 1. Conversion Issue  
From 2021 to 2023, the trial-to-paid conversion rate fell from **53% to 23%**, despite stable trial sign-ups.  
The key bottleneck lies **after the first visit**, not before ‚Äî indicating a product or experience-related friction rather than a marketing issue.

#### 2.  Behavioural Shift  
Conversion signals shifted over time:  
- **Pandemic era**: Usage volume (longer stays, more visits) was key  
- **Post-pandemic**: Behavioural intent signals matter more, such as:  
  - **Visit timing (weekday/afternoon)**  
  - **Delayed first visit (1‚Äì2 days)**

#### 3.  Key Segment Insights

| Segment         | Characteristics                          | Conversion | Strategic Implication                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Core Hours**  | Weekday Morning/Afternoon (staffed hours) | 42.5%      | High-intent users ‚Üí Refine onboarding, boost workspace appeal |
| **Out-of-Hours**| Night, Early Morning, or Weekend          | 33.9%      | Underperforming but large group ‚Üí Target with low-cost operational fixes |

### 4. Funnel Overview & Business Context

#### 4.1 Funnel Drop-off Summary (2021‚Äì2023)

| Year | Sign-ups (avg/mo) | Visitors (avg/mo) | Conversion Rate | Change   |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| 2021 | 351               | 218.6             | 42.8%            | Baseline |
| 2022 | 290.3             | 196.8             | 39.1%            | ‚ñº3.7%p   |
| 2023 | 277.7             | 201.8             | 33.6%            | ‚ñº5.5%p   |

> **Interpretation:**  
> While acquisition and visitation remained relatively stable, the conversion rate continued to drop ‚Äî especially in 2023.  
> This confirms that **experience post-visit, not acquisition volume, is the core issue**.  
> ‚Üí Strategy must shift from ‚Äúbring more users‚Äù to **‚Äúconvert the right ones better‚Äù**.


#### 4.2 Dashboard: Funnel Churn & Conversion Trend

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459fcc23-ca9d-4117-901b-019cff641b0e" width="700"/>

##### 4.3 Key Churn Rates

| Metric              | Value   | Interpretation |
|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Visit Churn**     | 32.1%   | 3 out of 10 users who sign up for trial do not visit the space |
| **Conversion Churn**| 62.1%   | Over 6 out of 10 trial visitors do not convert into paying users |

> **Insight:**  
> Most of the churn happens **after the trial visit**.  
> This highlights post-visit friction, indicating the need for improvements in onboarding, space experience, or follow-up strategies.


#####  4.4 Monthly Conversion Rate Trend (2021.06‚Äì2023.12)

- **2021-06**: 52.96%  
- **2023-11**: 23.17%  
- Downward trend of ~30%p, particularly sharp in late 2023

> **Strategic Note:**  
> This persistent decline suggests **structural issues**, not just short-term noise.  
> Likely causes include user behaviour shift, operational challenges, and market saturation.  
> ‚Üí Calls for a **fundamental review** of the trial experience pipeline.

---

##### 4.5 3-Day Trial Sign-ups vs. Conversion Trend

- Sign-ups remain volatile but generally steady  
- Conversions **continue to decline**, showing widening gap

> **Interpretation:**  
> While marketing still brings users in, the **product experience fails to seal the deal**.  
> ‚Üí Focus must shift to post-sign-up experience: onboarding clarity, motivation reinforcement, and space quality assurance.

---

### 5. Behavioural Shift: Pandemic vs Post-Pandemic

#### 5.1 Split: May 2022 (when COVID restrictions were lifted)

| Period         | Sign-ups (avg/mo) | Conversion Rate | Change |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Pandemic       | 335.8             | 41.1%            | ‚Äî      |
| Post-Pandemic  | 279.8             | 36.1%            | ‚ñº5.0%p |

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0336d8e5-ea6f-47ef-add9-d89db3d151da" width="600"/>

> **Interpretation:**  
> Post-pandemic users behave more autonomously and purposefully ‚Äî they prefer weekday usage and delay their first visit by 1‚Äì2 days.  
> Pandemic-era data reflects irregular usage patterns due to lockdown effects.  
> ‚Üí Henceforth, all modelling and strategy focus exclusively on post-pandemic behaviour.

### 6. Conversion Driver Deep Dive (Post-Pandemic Only)

#### 6.1 Behavioural signals were analysed using:
- XGBoost (for feature importance)
- Z-score √ó Volume contribution
- Logistic regression (for directionality)


#### Top Predictive Features (XGBoost)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb068ea-e0d2-4f9c-aa29-bddcd238d344" width="500"/>

> **Interpretation:**  
> Timing matters more than volume.  
> Weekday visits, afternoon hours, and 1‚Äì2 day planning delays are strong predictors of payment.  
> These signals indicate **intent-driven usage** over habitual or impulsive use.

---

#### 6.2 Contribution Analysis by Feature (Z-score √ó Volume Share)

##### a. `main_time_block`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91ed6065-4b61-4730-a02b-8de0068df98f" width="500"/>

| Time Block     | Conv. Rate | Z-Score | Volume Share | Contribution |
|----------------|------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Afternoon      | 45.7%      | +2.11   | 13.1%         | +0.277 ‚úÖ     |
| Early Morning  | 34.3%      | ‚Äì0.67   | 42.6%         | ‚Äì0.287 ‚ö†Ô∏è    |
| Morning        | 37.3%      | +0.06   | 32.2%         | +0.020        |

> **Insight:**  
> The Early Morning group is the largest segment but underperforms significantly.  
> Optimising this time slot experience could unlock large conversion gains.



##### b. `visit_day_type`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d58c0741-ab56-4b78-ac03-e82f6134b961" width="500"/>

| Type     | Conv. Rate | Z-Score | Volume Share | Contribution |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Weekday  | 38.4%      | +0.23   | 74.1%         | +0.174 ‚úÖ     |
| Weekend  | 28.5%      | ‚Äì1.47   | 17.2%         | ‚Äì0.253 ‚ö†Ô∏è    |

> **Insight:**  
> Weekend users represent a hidden loss centre.  
> Improving weekend experience or rerouting them toward weekday slots could boost overall performance.


##### c. `first_visit_delay`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f115cef0-f558-44ff-b2e5-06081c340074" width="500"/>

| Delay    | Conv. Rate | Z-Score | Volume Share | Contribution |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 0 days   | 31.9%      | ‚Äì1.41   | 53.9%         | ‚Äì0.386 ‚ö†Ô∏è    |
| 1 day    | 38.9%      | +0.63   | 36.1%         | +0.363 ‚úÖ     |

> **Insight:**  
> Immediate visits underperform. Encouraging a 1‚Äì2 day delay (e.g., via nudges) is a **simple but high-leverage tactic**.

---

#### 6.3 Combined Segment Analysis

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f7670b6-4b8c-45b3-9f6b-fdca497d5de0" width="500"/>

> **Interpretation:**  
> Combining `main_time_block`, `visit_day_type`, and `first_visit_delay` reveals **high-ROI micro-segments**.  
> These combinations outperform any single variable and form the foundation for strategic targeting.

---

### 7.Strategic Target Segments

#### 7.1 High-ROI Group

| Segment Definition                      | Users | Conversion |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|------------|
| Weekday Morning/Afternoon + 1‚Äì2 day delay | 1,325  | 42.57%     |

> **Action:**  
> These users plan and visit during ideal hours.  
> Optimise onboarding, reinforce workspace value, and automate delayed-visit nudges.


#### 7.2 At-Risk Group

| Segment Definition                   | Users | Conversion |
|--------------------------------------|--------|------------|
| Early Morning / Midnight / Weekend   | 2,290  | 33.93%     |

> **Action:**  
> Improve experience during low-staffed hours via:  
> - Digital onboarding  
> - Scheduled follow-ups  
> - Minimal night/weekend support



#### 7.3 Impact Simulation

| Group          | Users | Baseline CR | +1%p Gain | Conversion Uplift |
|----------------|--------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Core Hours     | 1,327  | 42.5%        | +13.3     | +0.35%p            |
| Out-of-Hours   | 1,560  | 34.4%        | +15.6     | +0.41%p            |
| **Total**      | ‚Äî      | ‚Äî            | **+28.9** | **+0.76%p**        |

> **Interpretation:**  
> Small improvements in just two segments could lift total conversion rate by +0.76%p ‚Äî without acquiring a single new user.  
> ‚Üí Low-cost, **operationally focused growth** is achievable.
